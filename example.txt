Once upon a time there was a good programmer who used git. He committed
regularly and wrote useful messages.

One day, he wrote buggy code! But thankfully he was able to reset to an
earlier commit. Instead of having to rewrite his entire project, he was
able to just restart the buggy feature.


After restarting the buggy feature, he found out that his earlier commit has a much bigger problem and hence he decided to add try catch blocks for his entire code! works like a charm :)

Now, there was anothe programmer who didn't ever use git! After all,
he was a good programmer and didn't need to. 

But one day, he made a mistake and wrote buggy code. He searched for hours for
his bug, but couldn't figure it out.

Luckily he knows about try-catch blocks that are solutions to every coding problems.So Exception handling saves the day once again!God bless the developer of Exception handling techniques!
