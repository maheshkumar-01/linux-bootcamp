Once upon a time there was a programmer. But he didn't ever use git! After all,
he was a good programmer and didn't need to. 

But one day, he made a mistake and wrote buggy code. He searched for hours for
his bug, but couldn't figure it out.

Write an ending to the story!
Luckily he knows about try-catch blocks that are solutions to every coding problems.So All is well!
Even if try catch fails, use nested try catch!
